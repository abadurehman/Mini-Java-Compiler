This aim of this project is to construct a compiler for  [Extended MiniJava](https://cs.rit.edu/~hh/teaching/doku.php?id=cc17:eminijava) language. The compiler is being constructed in various logical phases. The phases are defined as follows: 

1. Lexical Analysis: Separate a stream of characters into different tokens of the language which are described by using regular expressions.

2. Syntax Analysis
3. Name Analysis
4. Type checking
5. Byte Code Generation
6. Optimization

### Interface ###
Command-line is the primary interface for users to interact with this compiler. The format of command-line interface is as follows:

emjc [options] <source file>

As of now, there are six possible options. 

* ––help: Prints a synopsis of options
* ––pp: Pretty-prints the input file to the standard output
* ––lex: Generates output from lexical analysis as described in Assignment 2.
* ––ast: Generates output from syntactic analysis as described in Assignment 3.
* ––name: Generates output from name analysis as described in Assignment 4
* ––type: Generates output from type analysis

After executing the compiler with the option ––type for the source file filename.emj the compiler either accepts the program as a good eMiniJava program with printing out the following line:

Valid eMiniJava Program

Or, it prints out a set of errors (such as unknown identifier). Like the previous phases the format of an error message is the following:

<line>:<column> error:<description>
where <line> and <column> indicate the beginning position of the error, and <description> details the error.
